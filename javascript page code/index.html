      THE RITUAL<br><br>
      The lines of the symbols represent the flow of the ritual's magic and this flow must be managed carefully.<br><br>

Avoid causing the flow of power to rise and fall too sharply in sequence.<br>
The horizons begin and end the ritual, like the sun at dawn and dusk.<br>
The channels of power must not be wholly connected at either the beginning, middle, or end of the ritual.<br>
As it proceeds, the pattern of the ritual loses equilibrium and becomes more chaotic.<br><br>

Treat the flow of the magic with care. Once you have sorted them, activate them in order.
