Repo for the code connected to a hybrid game where some of the clues appear on a Micro:bit and on a Raspberry Pi.

CAUTION: This code contains spoilers! 

Thanks to Pippin Barr for his help with the "Konami Code" being used under "Javascript Page Code". Pippin provided a working version of the code that I customized for the project's needs.
